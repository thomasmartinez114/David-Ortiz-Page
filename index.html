	<h3>About David Ortiz</h3>
		<p>David Ortiz was first drafted by the Minnesota Twins and was only a bench player.  When Ortiz was traded to the Boston Red Sox, that is when all changed. He learned from teammates Manny Ramirez & Pedro Martinez on how to be a true professional and how to perfect his swing.</p>
		<p>In 2004, Ortiz was a key part of the Red Sox winning their first <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_World_Series" target="_blank">World Series</a> after an 86 year drought.  He is crowned "One of the Clutchest" hitters in MLB History and will one day be in the Hall of Fame.</p>
